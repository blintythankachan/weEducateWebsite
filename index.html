        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Freedom is a vital condition for happiness. Without freedom, we exist in a state of slavery. Even if we are free of external, physical bonds, we may nevertheless be fettered by internal bonds, such as disordered passions, false judgments, or even simply ignorance of our own nature and end. Education, properly understood and properly executed, contributes substantially to living a free and fully human life.Liberal education is the education of a “free person,” that is, one who is willing and able to live a mode of ethical and political life that is truly free. Toward that end, liberal education has for centuries begun with the liberal arts: the trivium of grammar, logic, and rhetoric; and the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">We help to get scholarship and internship for the students who show academic merit in their respective fields.scholarship is a grant of money to study at a college or university. Scholarships are often awarded on the basis of academic merit or because the student is part of a group. For example, there are scholarships for the children of firefighters.
            An internship is a job. It is supposed to provide insight into a career so students can gain experience that leads to more job opportunities after graduation. Some internships are paid; Some are not. Internships are meant to be temporary - either summer work or part-time during the school year.</p>
